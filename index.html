	  A minimalist writing zone, where you can block out all distractions and get to what's important. The writing!
	</p>

	<p>
	  To get started, all you need to do is delete this text (seriously, just highlight it and hit delete), and fill the page with your own fantastic words.
	</p>

	<p>
	  You can use <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <b><i>both</i></b> and <a href="http://zenpen.io"> urls </a> just by highlighting the text and selecting them from the tiny options box that appears above it.
	</p>

	<blockquote>
	  Quotes are easy to add too!

    <div id="third">
      <p>
	This is a third bit of text which is not hooked up to the editor.
